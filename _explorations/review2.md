I was heading back home from the airport after a full 36 hours of traveling. The only “restaurant” open on my path was this despicable place. I was a little turned off by the appearance of the outside, but I decided to give it a shot because you know what they say, “don’t judge a book by its cover”! But, oh how I wish I did! All they offered was raw beef, rice, and gruel. I’m a vegetarian, so I just went for the rice. It was hard… and made me nauseous. I couldn’t finish it, so I just went up to pay. The freak at the counter asked me for my Ena (wtf is an Ena?!). I asked if a dollar would work. The cashier abruptly slapped me across the face, handed me a sponge, and told me to get washing the dishes. I had no other choice, they made me wash dishes to pay for my “meal”. Would NEVER return. I am angry and tired!
