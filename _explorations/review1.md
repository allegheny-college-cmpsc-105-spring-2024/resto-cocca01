I dined at Fusion Flavors this past Saturday night. The shrimp tacos exceeded my expectations. The sauce paired with the tempura shrimp immaculately, and the fresh lime and cilantro brought an amazing freshness. The dish really melted in my mouth and the energy in there was electric. They had great music playing and people were dancing and singing all together. Even the chef came out to bust a move. I sat at the bar and got their special spicy margarita as well. Probably one of the best margaritas I’ve ever had. I won’t lie, I was slightly overwhelmed by how busy the place was! It was poppin! But that just speaks to the quality of their food and drink. My only complaint is that the portion size was slightly too small. There wasn’t quite enough taco per dollar. BUT, the flavor was so good that it was all worth it in the end.
