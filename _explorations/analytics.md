Google analytics provides a lot of interesting and informative data. Something that seems very relevant to me, for example, is that it shows which pages of your website are most visited. For my website, it was clear that most engagement was just with the home page, and least with the contact us page. As a restaurant owner, this information might be applicable because you can see where your customers are drawn to. Perhaps having contact information on the home page might be more helpful, or maybe people just donâ€™t feel the need to go to the contact page because they will inquire at the storefront? It is all very context dependent, but you can imagine how this may be insightful for restaurant owners.

Another super cool thing we can see in google analytics is where users are located. For example, most of the clicks onto my website were from the United States, however, I also had 1 user each from Turkey, Germany, and Israel. Generally, it is also very helpful to see the number of users your website is hosting over time. With this you can see how different time periods have more traffic and perhaps this can inform when is the best time to post announcements or you can make assumptions about what contemporary things might be impacting your engagement.
